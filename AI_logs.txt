I've simplified the portfolio website significantly! Here's what I changed:

**Simpler Design:**
- Clean, minimal layout with lots of white space
- Removed complex animations and effects
- Single-column layout that's easy to read
- Simple color scheme (blue accents on white/gray)

**Streamlined Content:**
- Combined navigation into the header
- Reduced to essential sections: About, Skills, Projects
- Simplified project cards without fancy styling
- Basic skill tags instead of elaborate cards

**Technical Simplifications:**
- Much less CSS (reduced from ~400 lines to ~150)
- No JavaScript animations or complex effects
- Standard web fonts
- Mobile-responsive without complex breakpoints

**What to Customize:**
1. Replace "Your Name" with your actual name
2. Update contact information (email, LinkedIn, GitHub)
3. Write your own about section
4. Add your actual skills
5. Replace projects with your real work
6. Add actual project links

The new version focuses on content over flashy design, loads faster, and is much easier to maintain and customize. It still looks professional but without the complexity.
